# NYC Concerts
A map of  your favorite artists' upcoming concerts. This repo uses the Songkick API with the Spotify API to map concerts in the NYC metro area (where I live). 

1: The python script reads a users Favorite and Followed Artists and writes a csv file of their names
2: The R script gets all the shows in a metro area (NYC), keeps only the shows of artists in the csv, and maps them
